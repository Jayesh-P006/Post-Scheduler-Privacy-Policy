    <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how this application (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our post scheduling service
      to connect to and publish content on third-party platforms, including LinkedIn and Instagram (via Meta’s APIs).
    </p>

    <h3>What this app does</h3>
    <p>
      Our service helps you draft, schedule, and publish posts to supported social accounts that you choose to connect (for example, LinkedIn profiles/pages and
      Instagram professional accounts). We only access data needed to provide scheduling and publishing features.
    </p>

    <h3>Community-based, not a business</h3>
    <p>
      This is a community-based app provided for community use and is not open for business. We do not offer paid services, run advertisements based on
      connected platform data, or sell personal data.
    </p>

    <h3>Data we collect and process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App account data</strong>: usernames/emails and basic account settings used to log into and administer this app (including team access, if applicable).</li>
      <li><strong>Connected account identifiers</strong>: identifiers and basic metadata for accounts you connect, such as LinkedIn member/page/organization identifiers and Instagram business/account identifiers (and related page identifiers where required by the platform).</li>
      <li><strong>Authorization data (OAuth)</strong>: access tokens/refresh tokens or similar credentials issued by LinkedIn and/or Meta that allow the app to make API calls on your behalf (for example, to publish scheduled posts). Tokens can be revoked by disconnecting your account or via the platform’s security settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Content you provide for scheduling</strong>: post text/captions, hashtags, links, scheduled date/time, and any media you upload (images/videos) that you want to publish.</li>
      <li><strong>Publishing records</strong>: status of scheduled posts (scheduled, posted, failed), timestamps, platform responses/IDs (for example, a created post ID), and error details for troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational data</strong>: logs and diagnostics (for example, errors and request timing) to keep the service reliable and secure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How we use the data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Connect your social accounts</strong> via LinkedIn and Meta/Instagram authentication flows and maintain those connections so scheduled publishing works.</li>
      <li><strong>Create and manage scheduled posts</strong> (save drafts, schedule times, store media, and prepare platform-specific payloads for publishing).</li>
      <li><strong>Publish content</strong> to LinkedIn and Instagram using their APIs at the time you schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>Show posting history and status</strong> (success/failure) and help diagnose issues (for example, expired permissions, API errors, or invalid media).</li>
      <li><strong>Maintain security and performance</strong> (rate limiting, abuse prevention, debugging).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform-specific notes (LinkedIn and Instagram)</h3>
    <p>
      When you connect an account, LinkedIn and/or Meta may provide us with limited profile/page/account information and authorization tokens so we can publish
      your scheduled content. The specific data accessible depends on the permissions (scopes) you grant during authorization and the platform’s policies.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies and tracking</h3>
    <p>
      We may use essential cookies or similar technologies for login sessions and security. We do not use connected platform data for third-party advertising.
    </p>

    <h3>AI processing (if enabled)</h3>
    <p>
      If AI writing assistance features are enabled, the text you provide (for example, draft post content) may be processed to generate suggestions.
      We use this processing only to provide writing/scheduling features and not for unrelated advertising.
    </p>

    <h3>Data sharing</h3>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal data. Data may be shared with (a) service providers needed to operate the app (for example, hosting and database providers),
      and (b) LinkedIn and Meta/Instagram APIs when we make API calls to connect accounts, upload media, or publish content.
    </p>

    <h3>Retention</h3>
    <p>
      Scheduled post content, publishing records, and operational logs are retained until you request deletion or an administrator deletes them, unless a longer period is needed for security, legal, or operational reasons. You can request deletion at any time (see Data deletion instructions below).
    </p>

    <h3>Your choices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can disconnect LinkedIn/Instagram accounts from within the app (which stops future publishing via those connections).</li>
      <li>You can revoke the app’s access from LinkedIn and/or Meta account settings at any time.</li>
      <li>You can delete scheduled posts/drafts and request deletion of stored data (see Data deletion instructions below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data deletion instructions</h3>
    <p>
      You can request deletion of your data by contacting us using the email in the Contact section below.
      To immediately stop platform access, you can also disconnect your accounts in the app and/or revoke the app’s access in LinkedIn/Meta settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h3>Not affiliated with platforms</h3>
    <p>
      This app is an independent service and is not endorsed by, affiliated with, or sponsored by LinkedIn or Meta.
    </p>
